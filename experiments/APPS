Searched around with Google.  Also searched sourceforge for 
"multi-threaded" and "multithreaded"

LOOKS GOOD:

http://freshmeat.net/projects/pfscan/
  Parallel File Scanner is a multithreaded parallel file scanner that combines the functionality of find, xargs, and fgrep. It has the potential of being faster than find+xargs+fgrep on systems with multiple CPUs, multiple disks, and a good file system that supports parallel operations.

  DONE. (Version 1.0).

http://sourceforge.net/projects/ctrace/
  Very small program.  Single global lock on a hash table.  Should be
  a good testcase for what we can do now.

  DONE. (Version ???)

http://sourceforge.net/projects/qsd/
  This looks pretty good.  Lots of different idioms, and a large
  number of global locks, though there are datastructures too (pool.c
  implements a pool-based allocator with a lock for the list of pools,
  and lock for each pool in the list).  I think it's basically
  self-contained.

  PROBLEM: requires postgres and some package named mhash.  I got
    mhash installed, but having it use postgres too scares me, 
    so I've moved on.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/mt-daapd/
  Looks good.  It's a webserver based ITunes server.  It's got
  pretty simple sync patterns, but uses datastructures.  Big.
  Registers handlers to deal with particular connection types.

  DONE. (Version 0.2.4, built with id3tag library 0.15.1b)

http://sourceforge.net/projects/retawq/
  Multi-threaded, terminal based web browser (can do multiple
  terminals at once).  Doesn't use any locking, under the claim
  that everything is thread-local.  We could run our tool to
  prove it.  21K lines of code.
 
  DONE. (Version 0.2.6b) Interestingly, the merged, preprocessed
    version is 66 KLOC.  At the moment this dies with a stack
    overflow; I notice there are a bunch of bad casts and such.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/multiseek/
  This is a web browser plug-in, apparently, to do a multi-threaded
  search; i.e., to send the same search to a bunch of different web
  search engines and then collate the results.  

  DONE.  A single file with a main()!  Version 0.97.

http://www.icecast.org/docs.php
  Possibly of interest: streaming media server.

  DONE. (Version 2.3.1)  I also have older versions that are slightly
  smaller, as Iulian merged them for updating.

http://freshmeat.net/projects/phttpd/
  Looks like it uses a lot of pthreads stuff, including thread local
  data via thread_setspecific.   Haven't tried to build it.

http://freshmeat.net/projects/pftpd/
  Pftpd is an implementation of an anonymous FTP daemon written from scratch. It uses multithreading (where available) in order to be lightweight, but still have high performance.  (Version 1.0.1)
 
  IN PROGRESS.  Fails to compile normally due to some missing stuff.
  This is a recent project, so I'm not sure what's going on.

http://freshmeat.net/projects/smtprc/
  SmtpRC is a fully configurable, multithreaded open mail relay scanner. It supports scanning of IP blocks, and can print the results to a Web page. It is intended for Systems Administrators to check IP blocks under their control.

  NOTES: uses function s_malloc instead of malloc.  In merged file, I
  turned this into a macro for malloc().  Also, when a function
  pointer is cast to void* in the call to fork, it gets "conflated"
  and is not counted as introducing parallelism.  Removed the (void*)
  cast to make this go away.

  DONE.  (Version 2.0.2).  Goes through.

http://freshmeat.net/projects/shweby/
  Shweby is a new ICAP enabled proxy server. This proxy passes HTTP requests and responses through one or many ICAP servers in order to be modified in their way to the origin server or to the client.
 
  IN PROGRESS.  Looks like this could be OK.  I haven't futzed with it yet.

http://freshmeat.net/projects/ufdbguard/

  IN PROGRESS.  Looks good so far, but still need to get merge to work.
  Looks like the multithreaded version is ufdbguardd.

http://freshmeat.net/projects/camsource/

http://freshmeat.net/projects/citadel/
  BBS groupware (server) for collaboration.  Robust and stable.  

http://sourceforge.net/projects/moodns
  Multithreaded DNS server.  Seems to be the right size (10K LOC).

http://sourceforge.net/projects/finop

----------------------------------------------------------------------

MULTI-THREADED BUT HAVEN'T LOOKED AT

http://freshmeat.net/projects/spyrius/
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mtpgsql/

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

POSSIBLE BUT NOT IDEAL

http://www.nessus.org/download/index.php
  Vulnerability scanner.  Looks big and icky.

http://www.mathcircle.org/topc/
  A compiler that targets multi-threaded C.  Could poke around to see
  if we can get it to generate C code directly.

http://www.mozart-oz.org/
  Distributed programming framework.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

NO GOOD

http://gftp.seul.org/
  Looks pretty good.  Multithreaded FTP client.  Datastructure per
  transfer, each with its own lock.  One issue is that it relies a lot
  on the GTK event library.  This means analyzing GTK and this code in
  order to get the proper control flow.

http://pan.rebelbase.com/
  Newsreader.  Looks pretty good.  Same problem as gftp: uses GTK.

http://freshmeat.net/projects/asunder/
  CD ripper.  Uses GTK.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/terravision/
  Doesn't appear to have the full source?

http://sourceforge.net/projects/strawmush/
  Multithreaded MUSH server (whatever that is).  However, there
  appears to be no source to download. :(

http://pi3web.sourceforge.net/pi3web/
  Multithreaded webserver, but written mostly in C++. Phoo.

http://oss.basjes.nl/SuckMT/
  Multithreaded news download client (sucks messages from a server).
  Apparently uses a shared queue among threads to manage a to-do
  list.  But written in C++.  Bummer.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/nullhttpd/
  Looked at this.  Has a bunch of calls to pthread routines, but
  doesn't appear to actually create any threads or lock any locks!

http://sourceforge.net/projects/mtclips/
  Looks pretty weird.  Doesn't appear to use POSIX API; not sure
  what it's doing.
