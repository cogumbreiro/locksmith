- pool.c and state.c seem to have two problems
  - .data is not reported as shared, even though
    it aliases .cur, which is shared
  - the local object lock is not considered non-linear

- forkloop2.c is imprecise
  - we should be able to get rid of this race, assuming
    we add liveness to the uniqueness results.
