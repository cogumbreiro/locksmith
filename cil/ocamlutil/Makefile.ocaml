  # Generic Makefile for Ocaml projects
  # Written by necula@cs.berkeley.edu
  # 
  # Features: 
  #   - keeps byproducts of building in a separate directory
  #   - handles dependencies automatically
  #   - user specifies just what modules go into a project and 
  #     everything else is done automatically
  #   - you can use one Makefile for several Ocaml projects
  #   
  # You must include this file in your Makefile. Before the include point 
  # you must defined the following variables (which are glob al for all Ocaml 
  # projects specified in one Makefile):
  # 
  # OBJDIR     - the directory where to put all object files. This directory 
  #              must exist (default obj)
  # DEPENDDIR  - the directory where to put dependency files. This directory 
  #              must exist.  (default obj/.depend)
  # NATIVECAML - if set then will use the native compiler
  # UNSAFE     - if set then will turn off safety checks (only with NATIVECAML)
  # PROFILE    - if set then it will compile and link with "gprof" profiling
  #              support (NATIVECAML mode only)
  # STATIC     - if set then it will compile and link statically
  #              (NATIVECAML mode only)

  # MODULES    - a list of all modules for all projects defined in the 
  #              Makefile. Give only the basenames (no directory, 
  #              no extension).  This is used to create the dependencies.
  # SOURCEDIRS - a list of all directories containing sources for all 
  #              projects defined in a Makefile. This is used to set vpath.
  # MLLS       - a list of all .mll (ocamllex input) files for all 
  #              projects defined in the Makefile. 
  # MLYS       - a list of all .mly (ocamlyacc input) files for all 
  #              projects defined in the Makefile. 
  # ECHO       - if specifically set to nothing then it will print 
  #              all of the commands issued. Set this in the command line
  #              if you want to see what is going on.
  #
  # COMPILEFLAGS      - if defined, then it is passed as argument to ocamlc
  #                     and ocamlopt
  #
  #
  # After you set all of the above you must do the following for EACH separate 
  # executable that you want to build.
  #
  # Define the following:
  # PROJECT_EXECUTABLE - the name of the executable you want to build. To take 
  #                      advantage of the naming scheme that separates the 
  #                      bytecode version and the native version, use the 
  #                      $(EXE) variable which is defined to either .byte.exe 
  #                      or .asm.exe. I typically put the executable in 
  #                      $(OBJDIR) as well.
  # PROJECT_MODULES    - the base names of the modules that make this 
  #                      executable in the order in which they must be
  #                      passed to the linker. Make sure that all of
  #                      the names mentioned here are also mentioned in 
  #                      MODULES.
  # PROJECT_CMODULES   - same as modules but for the C modules. These
  #                      do not need to be mentioned in MODULES
  # PROJECT_LIBS       - the base names of the libraries that you 
  #                      want to link in the executable.
  #
  #
  # Then include Makefile.ocaml.build to generate a customized
  # rule for making your executable.
  #
  # Example:
  # 
  # OBJDIR     = obj
  # DEPENDDIR  = obj/.depend
  # SOURCEDIRS = src src/special
  # MLLS       = mylex 
  # MLYS       = myparse
  #
  # MODULES    = mod11 mod12 mod21 modcommon
  #
  #  # Rules for project 1
  # PROJECT_EXECUTABLE = $(OBJDIR)/proj1$(EXE)
  # PROJECT_MODULES    = mod11 mod12 modcommon
  # PROJECT_CMODULES   =  
  # PROJEC_LIBS        = unix
  # include Makefile.ocaml.build
  #
  #
  #  # Rules for project 2 
  # PROJECT_EXECUTABLE = $(OBJDIR)/proj2$(EXE)
  # PROJECT_MODULES    = mod21 modcommon
  # PROJECT_CMODULES   =  
  # PROJEC_LIBS        = unix str
  # include Makefile.ocaml.build

# sm: two styles for echoing compilation progress:
#   style 1, by George:
#     - print English descriptions of what's happening
#     - set ECHO to "" to see *everything*
#   style 2, by Scott:
#     - do not print English descriptions
#     - print every shell command that is executed which has a side effect,
#       so that they could be pasted into a shell to reproduce manually
#     - omit some of the details of dependency generation
#
# to be able to choose which style, several variables are used:
#   @$(NARRATIVE)  - put this before English descriptions for style 1
#   @$(COMMAND)    - put this before shell commands which are to be
#                    printed for style 2; the command is *not* executed
#   $(AT)          - put this before shell commands which are to be executed,
#                    and also printed in style 2
#   $(ECHO)        - use in place of '@' for things not printed in either style
