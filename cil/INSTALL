 (For more complete installation instructions see the documentation in
  doc/html. If you do not see anything in there then you must have downloaded
  the sources from the CVS repository and must run "make doc" to creat the
  documentation. To perform this step you will need to install hevea
  (http://pauillac.inria.fr/~maranget/hevea) first)


 1. If you use Windows, you must first install cygwin. 

 2. You must install OCaml version 3.06 or higher (see instructions at
    http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml). Build from sources even on Windows.

 3. Download and unpack the distribution. 

 4. Run ./configure (from within bash if on Windows)

 5. Run make

 6. Run make check

 Now you can start using bin/cilly and bin/ccured as explained in the
 documentation (in doc/html).
